# Red vs. Blue Project
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the skills we learned as a pentester and SOC Analyst.

I performed a Red Team attack against a vulnerable Apache web server. The ELK server that I set up logged the activity information, which I then reviewed and an analyzed through Kibana as a member of the Blue Team.
